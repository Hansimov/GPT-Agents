I would provide you a Python script at the end. Please do following steps to this script:
[1] List the usage, functions and structure of this script.
[2] Re-write the part of print the text of multiple agents, especially line breaks. For example, if the output text of agent "Sage" has more lines than before, then all agents which print below of "Sage" should add the line number of starting printing with the added count of "Sage".


```py
import asyncio
import concurrent.futures
import random
import shutil
import textwrap
import time


class LLMAgent:
    def __init__(self, model="ChatGPT"):
        self.model = model

    async def answer(self, question=None):
        word_num = random.randint(20, 30)
        msg = f"[{self.model}]: I am {self.model}. ({word_num} words) "
        print(msg)
        for i in range(word_num):
            rand_num = random.random() * 0.3
            msg += f"<{self.model}_word_{i}>"
            await asyncio.sleep(rand_num)
            lines = textwrap.wrap(
                msg,
                width=shutil.get_terminal_size().columns,
            )
            self.task_runner.max_lines = max(self.task_runner.max_lines, len(lines))
            for j, line in enumerate(lines):
                index = self.index + j
                line = lines[j] if j < len(lines) else ""
                print(
                    f"\033[{index + j}A\033[2K{line}\033[{index + j}B",
                    end="\r",
                )
        return msg


class TaskRunner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_lines = 0

    async def ask_question(self, question="Hello, who are you?"):
        print(question)
        models = [
            "ChatGPT",
            "Sage",
            "Claude-instant",
            "Claude-instant-100k",
            "Claude+",
            "Bing",
        ]
        agents = [LLMAgent(model) for model in models]
        for i, agent in enumerate(agents):
            agent.index = i * self.max_lines + 1
            agent.task_runner = self
        tasks = [asyncio.create_task(agent.answer(question)) for agent in agents]
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

    def run(self):
        asyncio.run(self.ask_question())


task_runner = TaskRunner()
task_runner.run()
```

The text format `\033[{index + j}A\033[2K{line}\033[{index + j}B` does not work in windows terminal. It output the characters of `\033[{index + j}A` instead of move the cursor.


In windows, you should use `windows-curses`. Here is its repo:
https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/windows-curses

Please refer to this, and re-write the related codes.



Your solution gives this error: `_curses.putp() takes exactly one argument (2 given)`


Below is a in-progress python script which tries to use `curses` to async print texts from different agents.
Please based on the page, then do following steps, note that in each step, you should output your thoughts and results:
[1] List some most commonly-used functions for the `curses` module in this page.
[2] Analyze the codes below, then extract functions, then explain them.
[3] Re-write functions `ask_question` and `answer`, fill the "To implement" part,  to make the all agents output asyncly, and also process the line breaks properly.
[4] Improve codes. Note that you might use the concept of "lock" to avoid modifying some values (such as max lines of current terminal) with conflicts. 
[5] Improve codes. Note that once the lines of the output text from one agent has incremented, all agents below it should update the first line to start outputting their texts. You might need to add some decorators or notificators to trigger this update, then re-output the texts for all agents that below this agent.

AttributeError: module 'curses' has no attribute 'deleteln'

Then fix the error of `AttributeError: module 'curses' has no attribute 'deleteln'` in your previous codes of `LLMAgent` and `TaskRunner`.
