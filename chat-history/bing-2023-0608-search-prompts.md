> Search the web, especially latest and popular posts of Reddit and Twitter, then find some posts about making GPT as a teacher for students in different levels.

I found some posts on Reddit and other sources about using GPT as a teacher for students in different levels. Here are some examples:

-   One Reddit user shared their experience using ChatGPT as a teacher in a realistic way. They found that the most practical application for ChatGPT was in building rubrics, scaffoldings, writing instructions, and creating new assignments. [It saved them hours of work and allowed them to create an endless amount of examples, sentence frames, graphic organizers, word banks, and rubrics in a matter of minutes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12usxol/how_im_using_chat_gpt_as_a_teacher_in_a_realistic/)[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12usxol/how_im_using_chat_gpt_as_a_teacher_in_a_realistic/).
-   Another Reddit user shared their excitement about using ChatGPT to assist their teaching. [They gave it a few commands and it created a pretty decent lesson plan and then a really good vocabulary test in just a minute](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/115i24d/chat_gpt_and_education/)[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/115i24d/chat_gpt_and_education/).
-   A post on Technology Review discussed how advanced chatbots like ChatGPT could be used as powerful classroom aids that make lessons more interactive, teach students media literacy, generate personalized lesson plans, save teachers time on admin, and more[3](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/06/1071059/chatgpt-change-not-destroy-education-openai/).
