I would like to use Python to develop a multiple line output program.
When the program output texts to windows terminal, it can update multiple lines asyncly at the same time.
For example, here is a simulated env for input and text output programs:

```
[input]: Please provide me several suggestions on the travel plan in Shanghai in one day.
[program1]: I have 3 suggestions for you ... <Keep async updating texts>
[program2]: Here are my suggestions : ... <Keep async updating texts>
[program3]: You should first ... <Keep async updating texts>
```

Please search the web, and list several high-quality solutions for my requirement.


Great! Now could you 1st search the web first, 2nd write a script in Python to show me how this can be done.

I run this script in windows, but it does not work as what i expect. I would like it to update multiple lines asyncly.

Your new solution gives me this error. Please analyze it, then fix it.
