There are several ways to run multiple Python functions at the same time. One way is to use the **threading** module. Here’s an example of how you can do it [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2957116/how-to-run-multiple-functions-at-the-same-time):

    from threading import Thread
    
    def func1():
        print('Working')
    
    def func2():
        print('Working')
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        Thread(target=func1).start()
        Thread(target=func2).start()
    

Copy

Another way is to use the **multiprocessing** module. Here’s an example [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18864859/executing-multiple-functions-simultaneously):

    from multiprocessing import Process
    
    def func1():
        #does something
    
    def func2():
        #does something
    
    if __name__=='__main__':
        p1 = Process(target=func1)
        p1.start()
        p2 = Process(target=func2)
        p2.start()
    

Copy

You can also use **Ray**, a system that allows you to easily parallelize and distribute your Python code [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2957116/how-to-run-multiple-functions-at-the-same-time).

    import ray
    
    ray.init()
    
    # Define functions you want to execute in parallel using
    # the ray.remote decorator.
    @ray.remote
    def func1():
        print("Working")
    
    @ray.remote
    def func2():
        print("Working")
    
    # Execute func1 and func2 in parallel.
    ray.get([func1.remote(), func2.remote()])
    

Copy

Which method you choose depends on your specific needs and requirements. [For example, if your functions are CPU-bound, then using the multiprocessing module might be a better choice](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2957116/how-to-run-multiple-functions-at-the-same-time) [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2957116/how-to-run-multiple-functions-at-the-same-time). If you need to handle network requests and responses, you might want to consider using an asynchronous approach with a library like asyncio.

> My program has a lot of network requests and responses, so:
> [1] Write several example functions which all use `await` and `async` with `asyncio` package.
> [2] Provide examples of using Ray to implement the feature of running these functions in parallel at same time, and receive and process the response accordingly.

Sure! Here are some example functions that use `await` and `async` with the `asyncio` package to perform network requests and responses:

    import aiohttp
    import asyncio
    
    async def fetch(session, url):
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.text()
    
    async def fetch_all(urls):
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            tasks = []
            for url in urls:
                tasks.append(fetch(session, url))
            responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
            return responses
    

Copy

In this example, the `fetch` function uses the `aiohttp` library to perform an asynchronous GET request to the specified URL. The `fetch_all` function takes a list of URLs and uses the `gather` function from the `asyncio` package to run multiple instances of the `fetch` function in parallel.

To use Ray to run these functions in parallel and receive and process the responses accordingly, you can do something like this:

    import ray
    
    ray.init()
    
    @ray.remote
    async def fetch(session, url):
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.text()
    
    async def fetch_all(urls):
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            tasks = []
            for url in urls:
                tasks.append(fetch.remote(session, url))
            responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
            return responses
    
    urls = ['https://example.com', 'https://example.org', 'https://example.net']
    responses = ray.get(fetch_all(urls))
    
    # process responses here
    

Copy

In this example, we’ve added the `@ray.remote` decorator to the `fetch` function to distribute it across any available nodes in a Ray cluster. The rest of the code is similar to the previous example, except that we use `ray.get` to retrieve the results of the parallel tasks.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Sure! One way to improve the `ask_question` method to run the `LLMAgent` instances in parallel is to use the `concurrent.futures` module. Here’s an example of how you can do it:

    import concurrent.futures
    
    class TaskRunner:
        def __init__(self):
            pass
    
        def ask_question(self, question="Hello, who are you?"):
            print(question)
            models = [
                "ChatGPT",
                "Sage",
                "Claude-instant",
                "Claude-instant-100k",
                "Claude+",
                "Bing",
            ]
            with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
                agents = [LLMAgent(model) for model in models]
                results = [executor.submit(agent.answer, question) for agent in agents]
                for f in concurrent.futures.as_completed(results):
                    print(f.result())
    

Copy

In this example, we create a `ThreadPoolExecutor` and use it to submit the `answer` method of each `LLMAgent` instance as a separate task. The `as_completed` function returns an iterator that yields the results of the tasks as they complete.

This approach allows you to run multiple instances of the `LLMAgent` class in parallel and receive and process their responses accordingly. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

If the `answer` method in the `LLMAgent` class will be replaced by a network request and response that returns a stream of data, one way to display the output in the terminal on the same line for each model is to use ANSI escape codes to move the cursor up and down. Here’s an example of how you can do it:

    import concurrent.futures
    import random
    import time
    
    
    class LLMAgent:
        def __init__(self, model="ChatGPT"):
            self.model = model
    
        def answer(self, question=None):
            rand_num = random.randint(1, 4)
            msg = f"[{self.model}]: I am {self.model}. Sleeping {rand_num}s."
            time.sleep(rand_num)
            print(f"\033[{self.index}A\033[2K{msg}\033[{self.index}B", end="\r")
            return msg
    
    
    class TaskRunner:
        def __init__(self):
            pass
    
        def ask_question(self, question="Hello, who are you?"):
            print(question)
            models = [
                "ChatGPT",
                "Sage",
                "Claude-instant",
                "Claude-instant-100k",
                "Claude+",
                "Bing",
            ]
            with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
                agents = [LLMAgent(model) for model in models]
                for i, agent in enumerate(agents):
                    agent.index = len(models) - i
                    print()
                results = [executor.submit(agent.answer, question) for agent in agents]
                for f in concurrent.futures.as_completed(results):
                    pass
    
        def run(self):
            self.ask_question()
    
    
    task_runner = TaskRunner()
    task_runner.run()
    

Copy

In this example, we’ve added an `index` attribute to each `LLMAgent` instance to keep track of its position in the list of models. In the `answer` method, we use ANSI escape codes to move the cursor up by `index` lines, clear the current line using the `2K` code, print the message, and then move the cursor back down by `index` lines.

This approach allows you to display the output of each `LLMAgent` instance on the same line in the terminal as new data is streamed from the network request. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

> Your solution seems to be good.
> Then could you enhance the `answer` function to make it generate streamed data in a random time interval, and the output in terminal make the output in the same line for same model.

Sure! Here’s an example of how you can enhance the `answer` method to generate streamed data at random time intervals and display the output on the same line for each model:

    import concurrent.futures
    import random
    import time
    
    
    class LLMAgent:
        def __init__(self, model="ChatGPT"):
            self.model = model
    
        async def answer(self, question=None):
            for i in range(5):
                rand_num = random.randint(1, 4)
                msg = f"[{self.model}]: I am {self.model}. Sleeping {rand_num}s."
                await asyncio.sleep(rand_num)
                print(f"\033[{self.index}A\033[2K{msg}\033[{self.index}B", end="\r")
            return msg
    
    
    class TaskRunner:
        def __init__(self):
            pass
    
        async def ask_question(self, question="Hello, who are you?"):
            print(question)
            models = [
                "ChatGPT",
                "Sage",
                "Claude-instant",
                "Claude-instant-100k",
                "Claude+",
                "Bing",
            ]
            with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
                loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
                agents = [LLMAgent(model) for model in models]
                for i, agent in enumerate(agents):
                    agent.index = len(models) - i
                    print()
                tasks = [loop.run_in_executor(executor, agent.answer, question) for agent in agents]
                await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
        def run(self):
            asyncio.run(self.ask_question())
    
    
    task_runner = TaskRunner()
    task_runner.run()
    

Copy

In this example, we’ve modified the `answer` method to be an asynchronous function that generates streamed data at random time intervals using the `asyncio.sleep` function. The rest of the code is similar to the previous example.

This approach allows you to generate streamed data from the `LLMAgent` instances at random time intervals and display the output on the same line for each model in the terminal. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

The error message you’re seeing indicates that the `answer` method of the `LLMAgent` class, which is a coroutine, was never awaited. This is because the `run_in_executor` method of the `asyncio` event loop is not designed to run coroutines. It’s intended for running regular functions that may block the event loop in a separate thread or process.

To fix this issue, you can modify the `ask_question` method to use `asyncio.create_task` instead of `run_in_executor` to run the `answer` method of each `LLMAgent` instance as a separate task. Here’s an example of how you can do it:

    import asyncio
    import random
    import time
    
    
    class LLMAgent:
        def __init__(self, model="ChatGPT"):
            self.model = model
    
        async def answer(self, question=None):
            beg_str = f"[{self.model}]: I am {self.model}"
            print(beg_str)
            for i in range(5):
                rand_num = random.random() * 0.5
                msg = f"<place_holder>"
                await asyncio.sleep(rand_num)
                print(
                    f"\033[{self.index}A\033[2K{msg}\033[{self.index}B ({round(rand_num,2)})",
                    end="\r",
                )
            return msg
    
    
    class TaskRunner:
        def __init__(self):
            pass
    
        async def ask_question(self, question="Hello, who are you?"):
            print(question)
            models = [
                "ChatGPT",
                "Sage",
                "Claude-instant",
                "Claude-instant-100k",
                "Claude+",
                "Bing",
            ]
            agents = [LLMAgent(model) for model in models]
            for i, agent in enumerate(agents):
                agent.index = len(models) - i
                print()
            tasks = [asyncio.create_task(agent.answer(question)) for agent in agents]
            await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
        def run(self):
            asyncio.run(self.ask_question())
    
    
    task_runner = TaskRunner()
    task_runner.run()
    

Copy

In this example, we’ve removed the use of the `concurrent.futures` module and modified the `ask_question` method to use `asyncio.create_task` to create a separate task for each instance of the `LLMAgent` class. The rest of the code is similar to your previous example.

This approach should fix the error you’re seeing and allow you to run multiple instances of the `LLMAgent` class in parallel and receive and process their responses accordingly. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.
