I would like to create a Python class to keep and remember the intermediate results of some chat bots, please suggest several names for this class, for each name, provide the reasons.

Could you search the web for the doc of Langchain, and find its similar names for this goal?

I would add more functionalities to the class, and it might have features to manage and process histories of chats, then based on this, please suggest several names for this class, for each name, provide the reasons.

I would like to choose the name of "ContextManager". Then how to design the data structure and functions for this class, based on my above descriptions and requirements?

Since the request and response of chats are in json format, I would like to use list of json as the data structure to store the intermediate chat histories. Another choice is to implement two class named "ChatRequest" and "ChatResponse", and use another class named "ChatHistory" to store the chat histories. Please suggest which one is better, and provide the reasons.

Good. Then is there any data structure or solution that could combine the advantages of the two solutions above?

what about using dataclass for this requirement in python?
