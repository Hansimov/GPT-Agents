Botpress offers a variety of specialized Agents to enhance your chatbotâ€™s capabilities and adaptability. These Agents are designed to perform specific tasks, each contributing to the overall performance of your chatbot. [Here, we introduce four of our agents: Summary, Personality, Knowledge, and Translator Agents](https://botpress.com/docs/cloud/studio/agents/)[1](https://botpress.com/docs/cloud/studio/agents/).

[For example, if you wish to include a conversation summary in a chatbot prompt using the Summary Agent, you could write: `Your conversation summary: {{conversation.SummaryAgent.summary}}`](https://botpress.com/docs/cloud/studio/agents/) [1](https://botpress.com/docs/cloud/studio/agents/).

> I would like to use Python as the backend of the chat UI, and botpress as the frontend. Please suggest three solutions to do this.

Iâ€™m sorry, but I couldnâ€™t find any specific examples of using Python as the backend and Botpress as the frontend. [However, Botpress is powered by natural language understanding, a messaging API, and a fully featured studio, allowing developers and conversation designers around the globe to build remarkable chatbots without compromise](https://github.com/botpress?language=python)[1](https://github.com/botpress?language=python).

> Great! Then how to create an expression for the botpress node to capture the begining of the user input?

In Botpress, you can use the `Capture Information` card to capture specific pieces of information from the userâ€™s input. This card allows the bot to stop processing and wait for the userâ€™s response while capturing a specific piece of information from the userâ€™s input [1](https://botpress.com/docs/cloud/toolbox/capture-information/).

To capture the beginning of the userâ€™s input, you can use the `Raw Input` field type. This field extracts the userâ€™s input as it is and saves it in a variable of type string. The extracted information can include any type of user input, including text, numbers, and special characters [1](https://botpress.com/docs/cloud/toolbox/capture-information/).
