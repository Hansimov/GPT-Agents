I would like to run multiple Python functions at same time.
The running functions should be independent and do not influence others.
Also, the functions are about network request and response, so I need to handle and manage the response in a natural and elegant way.
Search the web first, then search your knowledge base, then list several solutions to my requirements above.

Great! Then Do following steps based on previous answer:
[1] Design few indicators to evaluate the solutions.
[2] Use table format to show the comparisons with these indicators.
[3] Recommend the best solution for me.

Please Search the web, and Recommend more tools or packages like Ray.

My program is mainly about frontend and backend work in parallel, so:
[1] Design several indicators to evaluate the solutions.
[2] Use table format to show the comparisons of Ray and Dask with these indicators.
[3] Recommend the best solution for me.

My program has a lot of network requests and responses, so:
[1] Write several example functions which all use `await` and `async` with `asyncio` package.
[2] Provide examples of using Ray to implement the feature of running these functions in parallel at same time, and receive and process the response accordingly.



For example, I have below python example script.
I would like to improve the `ask_question`, to make it run the llm_agent at same time, then run in parallel.
Could you find a best solution to do this?

```py
import random
import time


class LLMAgent:
    def __init__(self, model="ChatGPT"):
        self.model = model

    def answer(self, question=None):
        rand_num = random.randint(1, 4)
        msg = f"[{self.model}]: I am {self.model}. Sleeping {rand_num}s."
        print(msg)
        time.sleep(rand_num)
        return msg


class TaskRunner:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def ask_question(self, question="Hello, who are you?"):
        print(question)
        models = [
            "ChatGPT",
            "Sage",
            "Claude-instant",
            "Claude-instant-100k",
            "Claude+",
            "Bing",
        ]
        for model in models:
            llm_agent = LLMAgent(model)
            llm_agent.answer(question)
```

Great! Now solve this for me.
The function `answer` in `LLMAgent` class would be replaced by a network request and response in the future, and the returned response from the network request could be a stream of data.
Then how to make the output in terminal make the output in the same line for same model.
For example, the later streamed output of `ChatGPT` should be in the same line of `[ChatGPT]: ... `, and the later streamed output of `Sage` should be in the same line of `[Sage]: ... `, and so on.

My updated codes is attached below. Please enhance it with above requirements.

```py
import concurrent.futures
import random
import time


class LLMAgent:
    def __init__(self, model="ChatGPT"):
        self.model = model

    def answer(self, question=None):
        rand_num = random.randint(1, 4)
        msg = f"[{self.model}]: I am {self.model}. Sleeping {rand_num}s."
        
        time.sleep(rand_num)
        print(msg)
        return msg


class TaskRunner:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def ask_question(self, question="Hello, who are you?"):
        print(question)
        models = [
            "ChatGPT",
            "Sage",
            "Claude-instant",
            "Claude-instant-100k",
            "Claude+",
            "Bing",
        ]
        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
            agents = [LLMAgent(model) for model in models]
            results = [executor.submit(agent.answer, question) for agent in agents]
            for f in concurrent.futures.as_completed(results):
                pass

    def run(self):
        self.ask_question()


task_runner = TaskRunner()
task_runner.run()

```

Your solution seems to be good.
Then could you enhance the `answer` function to make it generate streamed data in a random time interval, and the output in terminal make the output in the same line for same model.


Based on your solutions, I improve my codes, then run it with Python 3.9.6.

It raises the below error:

```
C:\Python39\lib\asyncio\base_events.py:1891: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'LLMAgent.answer' was never awaited
  handle = None  # Needed to break cycles when an exception occurs.
RuntimeWarning: Enable tracemalloc to get the object allocation traceback
```

Here is my codes which has this error:

```
import asyncio
import concurrent.futures
import random
import time


class LLMAgent:
    def __init__(self, model="ChatGPT"):
        self.model = model

    async def answer(self, question=None):
        beg_str = f"[{self.model}]: I am {self.model}"
        print(beg_str)
        for i in range(5):
            rand_num = random.random() * 0.5
            msg = f"<place_holder>"
            await asyncio.sleep(rand_num)
            print(
                f"\033[{self.index}A\033[2K{msg}\033[{self.index}B ({round(rand_num,2)})",
                end="\r",
            )
        return msg


class TaskRunner:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    async def ask_question(self, question="Hello, who are you?"):
        print(question)
        models = [
            "ChatGPT",
            "Sage",
            "Claude-instant",
            "Claude-instant-100k",
            "Claude+",
            "Bing",
        ]
        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            agents = [LLMAgent(model) for model in models]
            for i, agent in enumerate(agents):
                agent.index = len(models) - i
                print()
            tasks = [
                loop.run_in_executor(
                    executor,
                    agent.answer,
                    question,
                )
                for agent in agents
            ]
            await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

    def run(self):
        asyncio.run(self.ask_question())


task_runner = TaskRunner()
task_runner.run()

```


Your solution is great! I have improved the `LLMAgent` as below.

```py
class LLMAgent:
    def __init__(self, model="ChatGPT"):
        self.model = model

    async def answer(self, question=None):
        msg = f"[{self.model}]: I am {self.model}. "
        print(msg)
        word_num = random.randint(20, 30)
        for i in range(word_num):
            rand_num = random.random() * 0.5
            msg += f"<{self.model}_word_{round(rand_num,2)}>"
            await asyncio.sleep(rand_num)
            print(
                f"\033[{self.index}A\033[2K{msg}\033[{self.index}B",
                end="\r",
            )
        return msg
```

But this code still has a problem, that is when the text is too long so that it exceeds the line width of the terminal, the later texts would overlap the previous texts.
Please solve this for me.


Based on your suggestions, I have improve the codes to the following:

```py
class LLMAgent:
    def __init__(self, model="ChatGPT"):
        self.model = model

    async def answer(self, question=None):
        word_num = random.randint(20, 30)
        msg = f"[{self.model}]: I am {self.model}. ({word_num} words) "
        print(msg)
        for i in range(word_num):
            rand_num = random.random() * 0.5
            msg += f"<{self.model}_word_{i}>"
            await asyncio.sleep(rand_num)
            lines = textwrap.wrap(
                msg,
                width=shutil.get_terminal_size().columns,
            )
            for j, line in enumerate(lines):
                print(
                    f"\033[{self.index + j}A\033[2K{line}\033[{self.index + j}B",
                    end="\r",
                )
        return msg
```

This now can output linebreaks, but it has another problem, that is the the max lines would not be updated. For example, output of `Sage` is at the 2nd row, then the output of `Claude-instant` would be at the 3rd row, and so on. But when the output of `Claude-instant` exceeds to 4th rows, the output of `Sage` would be overlapped.
So the growth direction of output text should be up to bottom, and the total count of rows should be updated when there is a new line break in any of the agent output.

You solution is not working. It outputs multiple duplicated lines for each agent.
