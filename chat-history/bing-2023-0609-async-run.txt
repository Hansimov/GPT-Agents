I would like to run multiple Python functions at same time.
The running functions should be independent and do not influence others.
Also, the functions are about network request and response, so I need to handle and manage the response in a natural and elegant way.
Search the web first, then search your knowledge base, then list several solutions to my requirements above.

Great! Then Do following steps based on previous answer:
[1] Design few indicators to evaluate the solutions.
[2] Use table format to show the comparisons with these indicators.
[3] Recommend the best solution for me.

Please Search the web, and Recommend more tools or packages like Ray.

My program is mainly about frontend and backend work in parallel, so:
[1] Design several indicators to evaluate the solutions.
[2] Use table format to show the comparisons of Ray and Dask with these indicators.
[3] Recommend the best solution for me.

My program has a lot of network requests and responses, so:
[1] Write several example functions which all use `await` and `async` with `asyncio` package.
[2] Provide examples of using Ray to implement the feature of running these functions in parallel at same time, and receive and process the response accordingly.
